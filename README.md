# The Highest Paid Athletes from 1990-2020
***
## Project Overview
- **Project Title:** Highest Paid Athletes
- **Project Purpose:** This project exists to explore and analyze the pay of the 10 highest paid athletes from the years 1990 to 2020 utilizing Jupyter Notebooks, Python, and Multiple CSV Datasets.
- **Project Objectives**:
  - Utilized a publicly accessed dataset and analyze trends.
  - Create multiple visulations such as bar charts and scatter plots.
  - Perform multiple regression analysis

### Datasets Used:

The datasets used in this project were both sourced from Kaggle, which is described by Wikipedia as a, "data science competition platform and online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners under Google LLC." Kaggle allows users to upload datasets to be used by the general public for whatever type of anaylsis that a user may have an interest in. For the purposes of this project we utilized two datasets from Kaggle. The first entitled, "Forbes Highest Paid Athletes 1990-2020" and a second titled, "U.S. Inflation Data." The first dataset includes the highest paid athletes over the years 1990 to 2020 and includes their earnings for each of the respective years, it ranks them from 1 to 10, provides the athletes' nationality, sport, and previous year ranking on the list if applicable. The data set itself has the pay information for that respective year in the dollar amount of the day which is why we needed to utilize the second dataset, "U.S. Inflation Data" and the inflation information that it contains in order to compare the earnings based on the value of a dollar in 1990 to see whether or not there is a change over time on the amount of earnings an athlete on this list earns and to determine if athletes are getting paid more over time.

### Our motivation to use this topic:

- The sports industry is valued in US$ 500BN worldwide and is grows at a 5.9% annual rate. Just it sports sponsorships, it is estimated that brands will spend US$ 50BN this year and the single most valuable sporting event (the NFL Superbowl) is valued at $ 379 M. With all of these facts, we are curious to understand what the top figures in sport make, if their earnings depend on what sport they play and how their earnings have evolved over the years.
